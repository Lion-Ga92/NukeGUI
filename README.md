# NukeGUI

##### WELCOME!!!
###### To NukeTown Code Cracking
A short little code cracking game written with Python and the Tkinter GUI frame work. This game is still in development and it is the continuation of the Nuclear Launch code CLI tools game that is to be found within in this same GitHub profile.  I am writing this app to test my ability to design a small software and type and debug the code. 

###### I started to work on this app on a friday, and by the end of the weekend i was 3/4's of the way done with the main aspect of the game. 

Afterwards i will focus on rewriting the dialogue and clean up the interface. I am on the other hand running into a small issue. Which i am still not sure how to solve.
