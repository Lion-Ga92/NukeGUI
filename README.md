# NukeGUI

#### WELCOME!!!
###### To NukeTown Code Cracking
A short little code cracking game written with Python and the Tkinter GUI frame work. This game is still in development and it is the continuation of the Nuclear Launch code CLI tools game that is to be found within in this same GitHub profile.  I am writing this app to test my ability to design a small software and type and debug the code. 

###### I started to work on this app on a friday, and by the end of the weekend i was 3/4's of the way done with the main aspect of the game. 

Afterwards i will focus on rewriting the dialogue and clean up the interface. I am on the other hand running into a small issue. Which i am still not sure how to solve.


#### WELL THAT TOOK LONGER THAN I EXPECTED!!!! 
Although i claimed that by the end of the weekend i was about 3/4 of the way done, that was just with the design of the app. Getting the full functionality took me about two weeks, And this was for a simple project such as this. 

then again i am working with the hampering effect of being a noob.

##### As a noob what did i learn? 
Well obvious answer is how the syntaxt of tkinter classic works, but this was a very difficult app to finalize. As it required me to dig into subjects not easily covered by the basic tutorials. And also to try to figure out debugging strategies for the app when the traceback was not tripped by the code yet the app did not behave as expected. 

#### CANARY TRAPS ARE A MUST FOR STRING HEAVY APPLICATIONS
No seriously, remember the old canary traps miners put in the old shafts. That is what i called a method i heard about once. Which is to add random senseless words or strings to keep track of either who may have plagiarized a rough draft. But i my case i used them to keep track of the string flow in the app which allowed me to actually debug it when the bug was syntactically correct. 

#### PATIENCE IS A MUST 
No kidding! You really need to be patient when writing code as it is both time consuming and also exasperating 

and also i need to get better with multithreading 

### WARNING THIS APP HAS BEEN DEBUGGED AS BEST AS I CAN, BUT IT MAY AND WILL ACT WONKY FROM TIME TO TIME AS I AM NOT AN EXPERT THAT CAN DISABLE BUTTONS AND ENABLE THEM AGAIN. 

===============

## THE NukeGUI tkinter app was based off a diferent software i worked on, a CLI tools version that i decided to give it a simple GUI to but the CLI is a much better version.
